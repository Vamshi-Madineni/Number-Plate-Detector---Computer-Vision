# Number-Plate-Detector---Computer-Vision
Number plate detection in car images is a crucial task in various applications, including automated toll collection, traffic management, and law enforcement. The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of accurately detecting number plates in car images. The objectives include exploring and implementing different algorithms and techniques for image processing and object detection to achieve efficient and reliable detection results.

## Approach 1 - Uses Hough Transform
## Approach 2 - Uses Polygon Approximation & Perspective Transformation
